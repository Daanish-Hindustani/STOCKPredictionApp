# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Model
# Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model trained on historical stock data. Additonally a interface was built to view an analyze trends and predictions.

# Features
Model: Utilizes a deep learning LSTM architecture to analyze and learn patterns from historical stock data for accurate price predictions.
Data Preprocessing: Implements data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, normalize the data, and create sequential input-output pairs for training the model.
Training and Evaluation: Demonstrates the training process of the LSTM model and evaluates its performance on a separate test dataset.
Deployment on Streamlit: The trained LSTM model is deployed using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications. This allows users to input new data and receive real-time predictions.
